# GPT Delivr

GPT Delivr is a simple, no-code solution for deploying and integrating OpenAI's GPT chatbots into any website.

## How It Works

1. **Create the Assistant**
    - Create your assistant through the OpenAI Assistant [playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/assistants) and give him all the knowledge he needs.

2. **Fork the Repository**
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository page.

3. **Host It on Vercel**
    - Deploy the project to Vercel with one click.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
    - Go to your project settings on Vercel.
    - Add a new environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and set its value to your OpenAI API key.

5. **Generate the script**
    - After deployment, open the URL provided by Vercel.
    - Follow the instructions on the welcome page to set up and customize your chatbot.
    - Generate the embed script.

6. **Embed the Script in Your Website**
    - Copy the generated script.
    - Embed it in your website.

## Features

- **Multiple Assistants**: Once you've deployed the project on Vercel, you can embed as many assistants as you want on any website.

- **Different API Keys**: You can embed assistants associated with different accounts using different API keys.
